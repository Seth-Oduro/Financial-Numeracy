# Financial Numeracy and Inventory Efficiency: Examining Business Performance Through an Econometric Lens

# Abstarct
This study explores the impact of financial numeracy on the efficiency and size of inventory holdings in businesses, focusing on how improved financial literacy influences inventory management practices. Using a cross-sectional dataset of 1,487 businesses, I estimate a regression model to assess the relationship between financial numeracy and inventory size while controlling for sector, business age, owner gender, previous business ownership, and additional business ownership.
The econometric model employs the natural logarithm of baseline inventory size as the dependent variable, allowing for a percentage-based interpretation of changes in inventory levels. The results reveal that financial numeracy has a significant negative effect on inventory size, indicating that higher levels of financial literacy among business owners lead to more efficient inventory management. Specifically, a one-unit increase in financial numeracy corresponds to a 64.7% increase in inventory size, reflecting better turnover rates and reduced holding costs. Sectoral variations further underscore the role of industry context, with the service sector demonstrating leaner inventory practices compared to goods and mixed sectors.
These findings highlight the importance of financial literacy as a key driver of operational efficiency in businesses. By improving their financial numeracy, business owners can optimize inventory levels, minimize costs, and enhance overall performance. The results have practical implications for policymakers and training organizations, emphasizing the need for targeted financial literacy programs to support business growth and efficiency.

# Introduction

The efficient management of inventory is a critical factor in business success, as it directly affects operational costs, cash flow, and profitability. This study examines the impact of financial numeracy on the efficiency and size of inventory holdings in businesses. Financial numeracy, a subset of financial literacy, refers to the ability to understand and apply quantitative information in decision-making. My research aims to determine whether business owners with higher financial numeracy are better equipped to optimize inventory levels, reduce excess holdings, and improve turnover rates.

To build on this analysis, I extend the research question by incorporating additional business characteristics, such as sectoral variations, business age, owner gender, prior business ownership experience, and ownership of other businesses. These factors are expected to influence how financial numeracy affects inventory management, offering a more detailed understanding of the relationship between financial skills and operational efficiency.

## Scope of the Model

To address the research question, I developed an econometric model that examines the logarithm of baseline inventory size (ln(inventory_baseline)) as the dependent variable. This transformation allows for a percentage-based interpretation of changes in inventory size, making the findings more applicable to real-world scenarios. The independent variables in the model include:

    Financial Numeracy: A measure of the owner's financial literacy and skills.
    Sector: A categorical variable distinguishing between goods, services, and mixed-sector businesses.
    Business Age: The number of years the business has been in operation.
    Gender: A binary variable indicating the gender of the business owner.
    Previous Business Ownership: A binary variable capturing prior entrepreneurial experience.
    Other Business Ownership: A binary variable indicating whether the owner manages additional businesses.

## Hypotheses and Theories to Be Tested
This study is grounded in several key theories:

Human Capital Theory – Financial numeracy, as a form of human capital, equips business owners to make informed decisions about inventory management, leading to greater efficiency.
Inventory Management Theory – Concepts such as Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory control depend on financial literacy to minimize holding and ordering costs.
Behavioral Economics and Decision-Making – Financially literate individuals are better positioned to navigate bounded rationality and effectively manage inventory risks.
